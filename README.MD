 # ðŸ¦‡ Parcel Static Site Starter
 
 ### As far as I can tell, parcel is still pretty unstable. I would not use this in production.

This starter uses ðŸ“¦Parcel and is designed for static HTML sites. Build your pages in HTML, link between them with `<a>` tags, just like the Internet intended.

Includes typescript support with source mapping, PostCSS and some atomic css classes.

Comes with few opinions that are easy to delete, and simple config files that you can modify how you like.

### Getting started

```
yarn install && yarn dev
```

Modify index.html and see what happens. I dare you. Add as many .html pages as you like.
